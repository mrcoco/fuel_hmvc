#Compiled Using modular HMVC

This is just a regular FuelPHP installation with some slight configuration to work using modular HMVC approach. All credit goes completely to the fuelPHP group, and contributors. This is merely a reflection of the way I like to use the framework, and is not intended to replace or undermine the original framework. If you like to use HMVC concepts with fuelPHP this is a good base point for structuring your application.

And if you have not checked out FuelPHP, please do so on [Github/fuelphp](https://github.com/fuelphp/)
